                | The best 50 participants on the deadline will be shortlisted
                | for a physical test still on general knowledge, of which the
                | best five would be selected to represent the school in the
                | Grand finale. Your job as a contestant is to keep yourself on
                | the top 50 spot until the deadline. If you are displaced from
                | the top 50, it means you have to attempt the quiz again to
                | regain a spot in the top 50. Top applicants will win amazing
                | consolation prizes.
